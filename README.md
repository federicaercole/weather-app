# Weather App
A simple app built in vanilla JavaScript, from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).

[Live version](https://federicaercole.github.io/weather-app/)

## Features:
- Fetch data from [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)
- Show suggestion box with a list of locations
- Save the latest search data in local storage

## What I learned doing this project:
- Fetch data, use async functions
- MVC pattern
- Handle errors (try/catch block)
- Create an accessible suggestion box
- Use local storage
- Improve my knowledge about classes and this keyword
